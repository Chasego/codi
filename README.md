Detailed Description
  This repository is for personal improvement through programming and algorithm.
  There're several files for various sets of programming practises: including "Beauty of Programming"(Microsoft)
  For each file, there're several problems.
  For each problems, there're two parts
  
  -- "cc file" contains "error file" and "cc solution file"
  
    -- "error file": the mistakes I made from writing these code
       -- They're very helpful for improvement
       -- Each error file is followed by a "answer file" which indicates 
       -- Where the problem happens, what happens and how to fix
       
    -- "cc solution file": my solution files and cc is short for my name, Chi Chen
       -- Present the process of Optimization by myself
    
    -- "read me file": 
       -- Summarize what mistakes are made in each error file
       -- Summarize what improvements I achieve in the codes
    
  -- "solution file"
    
    -- The solutions come from internet or the related book
    -- Present the process of Optimization by others
