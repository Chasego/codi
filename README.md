Detailed Description
  This repository is for personal improvement through programming and algorithm.
  There're several files for various sets of programming practises: including "Beauty of Programming"(Microsoft)
  For each file, there're several problems.
  For each problems, there're two parts
  
  
  -- "cc error folder": 
  
    -- The mistakes I made from writing these code
    -- They're very helpful for improvement
    -- Each error file is followed by a "answer file" which indicates 
    -- Where the problem happens, what happens and how to fix
       
  -- "cc solution folder"
  
    -- My solution files and cc is short for my name, Chi Chen
    -- Present the process of Optimization by myself
    
  -- "read me file"
  
    -- Summarize what mistakes are made in each error file
    -- Summarize what improvements I achieve in the codes
    -- Describe my idea about solutions
    -- Describe others' ideas about solutions
    
  -- "solution folder"
    
    -- The solutions come from internet or the related book
    -- Present the process of Optimization by others
    
  -- "problem descripition file"
  
    -- Description of problems
    
  -- "list file"
    
    -- List what are ready to do
