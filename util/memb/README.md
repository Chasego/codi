1. This folder 'memb' is used to store src codes of each member. 

   For each member, you should create your own sub-folders. For example, I will create memb/cchen. Specifically, for leetcode src code, I will create memb/cchen/leetcode/ which is same as this [link] (https://github.com/Chasego/cod/tree/master/leetcode) .
