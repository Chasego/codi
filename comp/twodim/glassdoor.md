+ Software Data Engineer Interview

  + There were two phone screens with Two Sigma. 

  + The first was a simply introduction with HR. The second phone screen was with a senior scientist at Two Sigma. 

  + It took about an hour and it was VERY DIFFICULT! She asked me to explain the projects in resume in very detailed implementation and 

  + then asked about 5~7 questions about data science. Each question needs a very detailed explanation with the reason using these approaches

#General Process

  + The first step is a 30-minute phone chat with the HR. No technical questions were in the first round. 

  + The second step is a timed coding challenge hosted on HackerRank. I was asked to solve two problems using knowledge of data structures (__trees, hash tables, table internals__etc.) 

  + The third step is an hour-long phone screen with one of the engineers. Some questions were about projects on my resume. 

  + These questions can sometimes go really deep into implementation details and reasons behind design decisions. 

  + The majority of questions emphasized on the theories and concepts from the CS undergrad core curriculum: 
  
  + data structure, algorithms, OS, networking, compilers, and software engineering. 

  + The fourth and last step is on-site. In the morning there were three technical interviews, each taking about fifty minutes. 

  + An engineer came in with me resume, from which he or she found some starter questions. 

  + After the resume questions, the interviewer started to ask coding questions. 

  + Depending on the interviewer, the questions, and how much time was left, the questions could be whiteboard coding only, 

  + Or whiteboard coding plus peer-to-peer real coding on a computer. 

  + After three technical sessions, two engineers took me to lunch, which was explicitly stated to be not a part of the evaluation. 

  + I got to chat with them and ask a lot of questions. 
  
  + After returning from lunch, I met with a manager, who introduced his team and task to me. It was only about 20 minutes, 

  + since he was on a rush for a meeting. 

  + Then I met the HR whom I have been contacting throughout the recruiting process. The HR asked me some last questions, but nothing technical or behavioral.

#Coding Test

+ Two questions for the coding test, one involving pure coding and the other involving some data analysis.

#Onsite

+ four interviews (technical, behavioral, all self contained and all pretty reasonable)

+ full day interview on-site that included meetings with HR, developers, and some managers

+ You will definitely code something - starts simple and then gets more challenging. They will give you a simple algorithm to code and make sure you are covering corner cases. 

+ One related to bug revise and another related to system design. Get to know bit manipulation and iterator would help a lot.
